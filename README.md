## Overview

**NotionSync** is a cross-platform desktop application that bridges Canvas LMS and Notion. It automatically syncs your assignments from Canvas courses into a Notion database, helping students organize deadlines, plan study sessions, and stay on top of their coursework — all in one place.

### Why NotionSync?

- 📚 **All assignments in one place** — No more switching between Canvas and your planner
- ⏰ **Smart time blocking** — Generate study blocks based on assignment priority and deadlines
- 🔄 **Automatic sync** — Set it and forget it with scheduled background syncs
- 🔒 **Secure** — API keys stored in your OS keychain, never in plain text
